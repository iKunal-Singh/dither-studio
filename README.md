# INTRODUCTION TO DITHER LABS

**Dither Labs** is a powerful, GPU-accelerated platform designed for applying dithering effects to images and videos. Dithering is a technique used to create the illusion of color depth in images with a limited color palette.

## WHAT IS DITHERING?

Dithering is a technique used in computer graphics to create the illusion of color depth in images with a limited color palette. By applying patterns of dots, the human eye blends these patterns to perceive a wider range of colors than is actually present.
